	<div class="section0" name="Tools">
		<h2>My tools</h2>
		<p >
			My most used tools are C and the linux terminal<br>
			I have experience with Web Development but prefer low level languages as i find their functionality better<br>
			C libraries and APIs like SDL and Vulkan along with other ones for functionality<br>
			Shaders in GLSL as it works with my other tools well<br>
			I have made games mostly with Unity but am learning Godot<br>
			I use Manjaro and Mint linux daily and am competent at using linux systems<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section1" name="currentWorks">
		<h2>Current works</h2>
		<p>
			Currently i am making a game engine called "Demolition Engine" with C and SDL, it is a long term project and i do it on my own time<br>
			When not making the engine i am making shaders and games as they both intrest me<br>
			I also make some small side projects such as this website<br>
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section0" name="philosophy" style="margin-bottom:5%">
		<h2>My philosophy</h2>
		<p >
			My philosophy is simplicity<br>
			I dislike if things are overcomplicated and prefer simple things in almost all things<br>
			You can see this in mentality in work on this website as i have only html and css and want to keep away from Javascript<br>
			I dislike Javascript for the aforementioned reasons but i still use it if need be<br>
