		<h2>Longer than usual</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 29.Feb.24</p>
		<p>
			It has been longer than usual that i updated this blog because i forgot last week but i still did work<br>
			I have had school work so projects didn't move as fast as they could have but most of that work is now done<br>
			<br>
			The Demolition Engine got alot of errors fixed, now it crashes only sometimes which is good<br>
			Im making some new useful functions like SetTexture and really orienting the project towards a code focused engine witch to build a editor from<br>
			I might be a bit lost with the engine at the moment as i really can't figure out what i want to do with it but i am getting an idea to make
			it an open and editable engine for a more custom approach to engines where the engine molds to the game and not the other way around<br>
			This approach hopefully makes games made with the engine more unique and encourages games not to rely on the engine, this makes games harder to make
			but they are overall more intresting and have greater capability to be fun<br>

		<h2>A week or so goes by</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 18.Feb.24</p>
		<p>
			Fixed a good amount of bugs and issues in the engine, started developing files with the end ".demolition" in the established naming scheme<br>
			The website has gotten no new updates exept this<br>
			I have the next week off so besides doing some school work i can work on my projects and maybe try something new<br>
			Essentially no side projects are going forward at the moment including Mr. Freemanner as i want Demolition Engine to be the best it can be<br>
			I have done some shader work but the one i am working on is a bit tough currently<br>

		<h2>Improvements, i suppose</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 8.Feb.24</p>
		<p >
			I have updated this site a bit now so it is in a better state<br>
			It has still work to be done and i haven't added Javascript but that is fine<br>
			I hope some update i can have the games be playable on this site but that is not neccessary<br>
			The site works and is alright on handheld, if my browser doesn't lie<br>
			Overall not the most productive week but i got something done<br>

		<h2>A website is born</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 1.Feb.24</p>
		<p >
			Hello, this is my first blog<br>
			I hope i will update this every week or so<br>
			I am still trying to get this website to look the best it can and it doesn't have many features yet<br>
			Maybe will add some javascript but for the first iteration of this site it is not needed<br>
			Demolition Engine is in a bit of transitional period, i figured out how to organize better<br>
			I will update Project progress here rather than just commit logs that nobody reads<br>
			The site is not yet adjusted for handheld devices<br>
