		<h2>Improvements, i suppose</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 8.Feb.24</p>
		<p >
			I have updated this site a bit now so it is in a better state<br>
			It has still work to be done and i haven't added Javascript but that is fine<br>
			I hope some update i can have the games be playable on this site but that is not neccessary<br>
			The site works and is alright on handheld, if my browser doesn't lie<br>
			Overall not the most productive week but i got something done<br>

		<h2>A website is born</h2>
		<p >Markus Linnanen - 1.Feb.24</p>
		<p >
			Hello, this is my first blog<br>
			I hope i will update this every week or so<br>
			I am still trying to get this website to look the best it can and it doesn't have many features yet<br>
			Maybe will add some javascript but for the first iteration of this site it is not needed<br>
			Demolition Engine is in a bit of transitional period, i figured out how to organize better<br>
			I will update Project progress here rather than just commit logs that nobody reads<br>
			The site is not yet adjusted for handheld devices<br>
